# MHVR-to-SAF

# Introduction
This study proposed a novel methodology for directly estimating S-wave site amplification factors (SAF) from microtremor 
horizontal-to-vertical spectral ratio (MHVR) based on deep neural network (DNN) model. 

The DNN model was developed using peak frequency and the frequency-dependent relationship between MHVRs and SAFs.

The model can automatically produce site amplification factor of S-wave only from microtremor data.
